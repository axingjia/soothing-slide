A compact minimalist autoplay slideshow displaying calm and soothing images to calm people and empty their mind by just staring at it for a few minutes. It certainly does to me. I searched these images and find them perfect for this purpose. This github is not just about technicality, but also about doing something that benefit the world and communicating a message: "When life gives you tumoil and storm, there will be a bridge toward the calm sea and soothed heart".
